Artemis is a financial consulting company that has hired my company to update the secuirty on their software.

I was able to identify problems in the code base that required fixing such as input verification. It is important to code securely in order to conform to government regulations 
and to prevent the loss of sensitive data. Software security adds value in that it prevents the company from getting sued.

The flow chart that we were given to work with helped to guide the thought process that one needs in order to catch all vulnrabilities.


The approach I took was to follow the flow chart. Go step by step to assess dependency vulnrabilities, client/server security, code quality and so on.

After the code was refactored I used local host to log into the server and check to make sure that HTTPS appeared. 

Maven was the most useful tool I used in this class.

I'm already employed. 

Thanks for a great class!!
